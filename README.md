# ðŸŽµ TrackBack

**TrackBack** is a music-based game where players need to sort currently playing songs by their year of release.

Trackback lets you play with your own playlists â€“ currently supports Spotify & Apple Music, and is built to easily extend to other music services.

So far, user input is possible only via the command line.
A browser-based GUI is under development.
