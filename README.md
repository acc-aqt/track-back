# ðŸŽµ TrackBack

**TrackBack** is a music-based game where players must sort currently playing songs by their year of release.

You can play using your own playlists â€” it currently supports **Spotify** and **Apple Music**, and is built for easy extension to other music services.

The game consists of a **Python-based server** and two frontend options:

- a [Web UI](https://acc-aqt.github.io/track-back/web_ui/index.html)
- a command-line interface (Python)
