# ðŸŽµ TrackBack

**TrackBack** is a music-based game where players need to sort currently playing songs by their year of release.

Trackback lets you play with your own playlists â€“ it currently supports Spotify & Apple Music, and is built to easily extend to other music services.

The game consists of a game server (written in python). As frontend there is either a command line interface (written in python) or a web ui that can be used in any browser.

-------

# 1 Installation

## 1.1 Requirements

The game server is implemented in python. To run the server you need

- `Python 3.12` or higher
- `pip` for package management

You can check your installed versions as follows:

```bash
python3 --version
pip --version
```

## 1.2 Run installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/acc-aqt/track-back.git
cd track-back
```
(Alternatively you can download the code using `Download zip`.)

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install .
```

## 5 Development Setup - not necessary to run the game

If you are developing or testing and need to use the source code directly:

```bash
make setup-venv   # Sets up virtual environment (.venv/)
make install      # Installs in develop mode
make test         # Runs tests
```
