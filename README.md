   2. Go to setting and note down the following credentials:
      - `Client ID`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code ("Download zip").
2. On the top level of the created directory call 'pip install .'


## Execution

### Using Spotify
Inside the track-back directory create a .env file containing the information found in the spotify developers section:

```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=your-redirect-uri
```

In the config.toml following setting is required:

```
music_provider = "spotify"
```

Call `track-back` to play the game.

You will need to authenticate with a spotify account that has been registered in the spotify for developers section.

### Using AppleMusic

In the config.toml following setting is required:

```
music_provider = "applemusic"
```

The Music app must be running and a playlist to be used for the game must be selected.

Call `track-back` to play the game.

## Development Setup (if needed)

If you are developing or testing and need to use the source code directly:

- Run `make setup-venv` to create and activate a virtual environment. The python interpreter is located in `.venv/bin/python3`.

- Run `make install` to install the project in develop mode.

- Run `make test` to run the tests. ToDo: implement tests.
